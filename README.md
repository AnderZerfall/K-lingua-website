Hello there, FUKURO is on the line!
I'm honoured to introduce you to my recent commercial project - The k-lingua website!

Let's dive into more details.
## Project's Goal & Requirements

K-lingua is a simple, but still professional website built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript for a translation company based in the Czech Republic.

The main goal of this project was to create a clean and user-friendly site that represents the company’s translation services and provides an easy way for users to contact them. The website includes sections for services, pricing, testimonials, and a contact form.

**Project's Requirements**

- _Creating nice and clean UI for K-lingua’s website in Figma including the following pages: Pricing, Who Are we, How we Work, Benefits, Contact, Home_
- _Redesigning and implementing K-lingua’s website pages for different translation services_
- _Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile-first design principles_
- _Creating optimized web pages for speed, performance, and SEO to enhance site discoverability and user engagement._
- _Ensure adding simple & cute animations to keep the user engaged_

## Key features

- **Performance**: To improve UX, I've kept things simple and minimised the amount of necessary animations
- **Optimized for SEO**: All blocks use semantic tags, alt attributes
- **Responsive design. Mobile first**: Our website is designed to be displayed optimally both on mobiles and desktops
- **Cute, light animations**: To keep users engaged and improve user experience.
- **Backend-free (Contact form)**: Due to the project's budget, the client insisted on implementing a backend-free application form, and so I did. Using Web3Forms I was able to implement a simple email system for my client.
