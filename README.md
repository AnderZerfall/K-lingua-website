Hello there, FUKURO is on the line!
I'm honoured to introduce you to my recent commercial project - K-lingua website!

Let's dive into more details.

## Project's Goal & Requirements

K-lingua is a simple, but still professional website built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript for a translation company based in the Czech Republic.

The main goal of this project was to create a clean and user-friendly site that represents the company’s translation services and provides an easy way for users to contact them. The website includes sections for services, pricing, testimonials, and a contact form.

**Project's Requirements**
- *Creating nice and clean UI for K-lingua’s website in Figma including following pages: Pricing, Who Are we, How we Work, Benefits, Contact, Home*
- *Redesigning and implementing K-lingua’s website pages for different translation services*
- *Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile-first design principles*
- *Creating optimized web pages for speed, performance, and SEO to enhance site discoverability and user engagement.*
- *Ensure adding simple & cute animations to keep the user engaged*

 ## Key features

- **Perfomance**: Slider components can be changed dynamically by parsing different props for headlines & images.
- **Optimized for SEO**: To improve UI, we added small cute animations and loaders.
- **Responsive design. Mobile first**: Our website is designed to be displayed optimally both on mobiles and desktops
- **Cute, light animations**: To save users' eyes, we added the dark mode to our website.
- **Backend-free (Contact form)**: Due to the budget of the project, the client was insisting on implementing backend-free application form, and so I did. Using Web3Forms I was able to implement simple email system for my client.

## Used Technologies
- **HTML5**: The core of the project
- **BEM**
- **JavaScript**: for adding dynamic features, like burger menu handling, switches, animations.
- **SASS**: easy styling!
- **Prettier**: just some sprinkles to make our code readable.
- **Web3Forms**: for implementing contact form without backend
- **Parcel**: for building the project
- **GithubPages**: for project deployment
